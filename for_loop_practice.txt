Exercise 1: Print the following pattern
Write a program to print the following number pattern using a loop.

1 
1 2 
1 2 3 
1 2 3 4 
1 2 3 4 5


Exercise 2: Write a program to print multiplication table of a given number
For example, num = 2 so the output should be

2
4
6
8
10
12
14
16
18
20


Exercise 3: Count the total number of digits in a number using while loop
Write a program to count the total number of digits in a number using a while loop.

For example, the number is 75869, so the output should be 5.


Exercise 4: Print the following pattern
Write a program to use for loop to print the following reverse number pattern

5 4 3 2 1 
4 3 2 1 
3 2 1 
2 1 
1


Exercise 5: Print list in reverse order using a loop
Given:

list1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Expected output:

50
40
30
20
10


Exercise 6: Display numbers from -10 to -1 using for loop
Expected output:

-10
-9
-8
-7
-6
-5
-4
-3
-2
-1


Exercise 7: Write a program to display all prime numbers within a range
Note: A Prime Number is a number that cannot be made by multiplying other whole numbers. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers

Examples:

6 is not a prime mumber because it can be made by 2×3 = 6
37 is a prime number because no other whole numbers multiply together to make it.
Given:

# range
start = 25
end = 50
Expected output:

Prime numbers between 25 and 50 are:
29
31
37
41
43
47


Exercise 8: Display Fibonacci series up to 10 terms
The Fibonacci Sequence is a series of numbers. The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. The first two numbers are 0 and 1.

For example, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21. The next number in this series above is 13+21 = 34.

Expected output:

Fibonacci sequence:
0  1  1  2  3  5  8  13  21  34


Exercise 9: Reverse a given integer number using while loop
Given:

76542

Expected output:

24567


Exercise 10: Find the sum of the series upto n terms
Write a program to calculate the sum of series up to n term. For example, if n =5 the series will become 2 + 22 + 222 + 2222 + 22222 = 24690

Given:

# number of terms
n = 5
Expected output:

24690


Exercise 11: Print the following pattern
Write a program to print the following start pattern using the for loop

* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * 
* * * 
* *

Exercise 12: Find all of the numbers from 1-1000 that are divisible by 7


Exercise 13: Find all of the numbers from 1-1000 that have a 3 in them


Exercise 14: Count the number of spaces in a string


Exercise 15: Create a list of all the consonants in the string “Yellow Yaks like yelling and yawning and yesturday they yodled while eating yuky yams”


Exercise 16: Get the index and the value as a tuple for items in the list ['hi', 4, 8.99, 'apple', ('t','b','n')]  Result would look like (index, value), (index, value)


Exercise 17: Find the common numbers in two lists (without using a tuple or set) list_a = 1, 2, 3, 4, list_b = 2, 3, 4, 5


Exercise 18: Get only the numbers in a sentence like ‘In 1984 there were 13 instances of a protest with over 1000 people attending’


Exercise 19: Given numbers = range(20), produce a list containing the word ‘even’ if a number in the numbers is even, and the word ‘odd’ if the number is odd. Result would look like ‘odd’,’odd’, ‘even’


Exercise 20: Produce a list of tuples consisting of only the matching numbers in these lists list_a = 1, 2, 3,4,5,6,7,8,9, list_b = 2, 7, 1, 12. Result would look like (4,4), (12,12)


Exercise 21: Find all of the words in a string that are less than 4 letters
